# UTXO dump tools
This repository contains various converting and processing tools for dumps of
the Bitcoin UTXO set, as generated by Bitcoin Core via the `dumptxoutset` RPC.
It was created in the course of reviewing of testing pull request #24952
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952), which adds an option to dump
the UTXO set in SQLite database format.

## `utxo_to_sqlite`

`utxo_to_sqlite` is a simple tool for converting a compact-serialized UTXO set
to a SQLite database.

Run via:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/theStack/utxo_sqlite_tools.git
$ cd utxo_sqlite_tools/utxo_to_sqlite
$ go run utxo_to_sqlite.go ~/.bitcoin/utxo.dat ./utxo.sqlite
```

Note that the first run likely takes longer, as golang has to fetch and build
the SQLite library (https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) first.

# TODO
- add verification tool that calculates the MuHash of a sqlite UTXO set
